# Specification Quality Checklist: End-to-End Terraform Validation Pipeline

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-30  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All quality criteria met

### Detailed Review

#### Content Quality Assessment
- ✅ **No implementation details**: Specification focuses on WHAT and WHY, not HOW. Mentions GitHub Actions only as an assumption, not a requirement.
- ✅ **User value focus**: All user stories clearly articulate value to provider maintainers (catching bugs, preventing regressions, increasing confidence)
- ✅ **Non-technical language**: Written from maintainer perspective without requiring technical implementation knowledge
- ✅ **Complete sections**: All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are fully populated

#### Requirement Completeness Assessment
- ✅ **No clarification markers**: All requirements are concrete and well-defined with no [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
- ✅ **Testable requirements**: Each FR can be validated (e.g., "pipeline MUST execute terraform plan" is verifiable)
- ✅ **Measurable success criteria**: All SC include specific metrics (percentages, time limits, counts)
- ✅ **Technology-agnostic criteria**: Success criteria focus on outcomes ("pipeline completes successfully") not implementation
- ✅ **Complete acceptance scenarios**: Each user story has 3-4 Given-When-Then scenarios
- ✅ **Edge cases identified**: 7 specific edge cases documented covering failure scenarios and boundary conditions
- ✅ **Bounded scope**: Clear focus on CI/CD validation pipeline, with explicit assumptions about test environments
- ✅ **Dependencies documented**: Assumptions section lists 8 clear assumptions about infrastructure and approach

#### Feature Readiness Assessment
- ✅ **Clear acceptance criteria**: Each of 6 user stories has detailed acceptance scenarios
- ✅ **Primary flows covered**: All critical flows covered (build → plan → apply → drift detection)
- ✅ **Measurable outcomes**: 12 success criteria with specific targets (e.g., "under 10 minutes", "100% validation", "80% reduction")
- ✅ **No implementation leaks**: Specification maintains abstraction level appropriate for planning phase

## Notes

This specification is ready to proceed to the planning phase (`/speckit.plan`). The feature is well-defined with:
- 6 prioritized user stories (4 P1, 1 P2, 1 P3) enabling incremental delivery
- 20 functional requirements covering all aspects of the validation pipeline
- 12 measurable success criteria for validating feature success
- Comprehensive edge case analysis
- Clear assumptions and scope boundaries

No additional clarifications or updates needed before planning.
