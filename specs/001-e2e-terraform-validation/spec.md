# Feature Specification: End-to-End Terraform Validation Pipeline

**Feature Branch**: `001-e2e-terraform-validation`  
**Created**: 2025-10-30  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to improve the projects build and testing pipeline. So everytime we do CI/CD, I want to test the provider to create the Terraform resources, do a plan and apply and do an apply afterwards to verify there are no changes."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Automated Provider Build Verification (Priority: P1)

As a provider maintainer, when I push code changes or create a pull request, the CI/CD pipeline automatically builds the provider binary and validates that it compiles successfully with all dependencies.

**Why this priority**: This is foundational - without a working provider binary, no other testing can occur. Catching build failures immediately prevents broken code from merging.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by triggering a CI build on a code change and verifying the provider binary is created successfully without compilation errors.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a code change is pushed to a branch, **When** the CI pipeline runs, **Then** the provider binary is compiled successfully and artifact is available for testing
2. **Given** the provider has dependency updates, **When** the CI pipeline runs, **Then** all dependencies are resolved and the build completes without errors
3. **Given** a compilation error exists in the code, **When** the CI pipeline runs, **Then** the build fails with clear error messages indicating the issue

### User Story 2 - Terraform Plan Validation (Priority: P1)

As a provider maintainer, when CI/CD runs, the pipeline creates real Terraform configurations using the provider, executes `terraform plan`, and validates that the plan completes successfully without errors for all supported resource types.

**Why this priority**: Terraform plan is the first real-world validation that the provider works correctly. It catches schema issues, validation errors, and configuration problems before any resources are created.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating sample Terraform configurations for key resource types, running terraform init and plan, and verifying successful plan generation with expected resource changes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the provider binary is built, **When** a Terraform configuration uses the provider to generate resource names, **Then** terraform plan executes successfully and shows the expected resource changes
2. **Given** configurations for multiple resource types (storage accounts, VMs, networks), **When** terraform plan is executed, **Then** all resource names are generated correctly and validation passes
3. **Given** invalid input parameters in the configuration, **When** terraform plan is executed, **Then** the provider returns clear validation errors before planning
4. **Given** the provider's naming conventions (cafclassic, cafrandom, random, passthrough), **When** terraform plan is executed for each convention, **Then** all conventions generate valid resource names that pass plan validation

---

### User Story 3 - Terraform Apply and Resource Creation (Priority: P1)

As a provider maintainer, when CI/CD runs, the pipeline executes `terraform apply` to actually create the resources using the generated names, validating that the provider-generated names work with actual Azure resource creation.

**Why this priority**: Apply is the ultimate validation - it proves the provider-generated names comply with Azure's actual API validation rules, not just our regex patterns. This catches real-world edge cases.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running terraform apply on test configurations, verifying resources are created successfully with the generated names, and checking that Azure accepts the names.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a successful terraform plan, **When** terraform apply is executed, **Then** all resources are created successfully using the provider-generated names
2. **Given** resources with different naming constraints (storage accounts, key vaults, VMs), **When** terraform apply is executed, **Then** Azure accepts all generated names and resources are created
3. **Given** edge cases like maximum length names or special character handling, **When** terraform apply is executed, **Then** the provider generates compliant names that Azure accepts
4. **Given** multiple resources requiring unique names, **When** terraform apply is executed with random suffixes, **Then** all resources are created with unique, non-conflicting names

---

### User Story 4 - Drift Detection with Second Apply (Priority: P1)

As a provider maintainer, after the initial apply succeeds, the pipeline runs a second `terraform apply` to verify there are no unexpected changes or drift, confirming the provider's state management is correct.

**Why this priority**: This is the critical validation that the provider doesn't have hidden bugs causing drift. If a second apply shows changes when nothing changed, it indicates state management issues, random seed problems, or timestamp issues.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running terraform apply twice in succession without any configuration changes and verifying the second apply reports "No changes" or exits with no modifications.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** resources have been created with the first apply, **When** terraform apply is run a second time without configuration changes, **Then** Terraform reports "No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration."
2. **Given** the provider uses random suffixes, **When** the second apply runs, **Then** the random values remain stable (no drift) because the random seed is properly managed in state
3. **Given** the provider generates names with timestamps or other dynamic elements, **When** the second apply runs, **Then** no drift is detected because all dynamic values are properly stored in state
4. **Given** multiple resource types with different validation rules, **When** the second apply runs, **Then** none of the resources show unexpected changes or require updates

---

### User Story 5 - Multi-Environment Testing (Priority: P2)

As a provider maintainer, the pipeline tests the provider against multiple Terraform versions and multiple naming conventions to ensure broad compatibility.

**Why this priority**: Ensures the provider works reliably across different user environments and Terraform versions, preventing version-specific bugs and convention-specific issues.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the validation pipeline with different Terraform versions (e.g., 1.5.x, 1.6.x, 1.7.x) and different naming conventions, verifying all combinations succeed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** different Terraform versions (current, previous, next), **When** the pipeline runs plan and apply for each version, **Then** all versions complete successfully without version-specific errors
2. **Given** all naming conventions (cafclassic, cafrandom, random, passthrough), **When** the pipeline tests each convention, **Then** each convention produces valid names and passes drift detection
3. **Given** configurations testing resource type coverage, **When** the pipeline runs, **Then** all 395 supported resource types are validated for name generation correctness

### User Story 6 - CI/CD Pipeline Performance (Priority: P3)

As a provider maintainer, the validation pipeline completes in a reasonable time (under 10 minutes for quick validation, under 30 minutes for comprehensive validation) to enable fast feedback loops.

**Why this priority**: Fast feedback is important for developer productivity, but functionality correctness is more critical. This is an optimization once the core validation works.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by measuring pipeline execution time from start to finish and verifying it meets the time targets.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a pull request triggers the pipeline, **When** the quick validation runs (subset of resources), **Then** the pipeline completes in under 10 minutes
2. **Given** a merge to main branch triggers the pipeline, **When** the comprehensive validation runs (all resources), **Then** the pipeline completes in under 30 minutes
3. **Given** pipeline failures occur, **When** the pipeline runs, **Then** failures are detected and reported within 5 minutes to provide fast feedback

### Edge Cases

- What happens when Azure API is unavailable or rate-limited during the apply phase?
- How does the pipeline handle partial failures where some resources apply successfully but others fail?
- What happens when Terraform state becomes corrupted or locked during the test?
- How does the pipeline handle resources that take a long time to create (e.g., AKS clusters)?
- What happens when provider-generated names conflict with existing resources in the test environment?
- How does the pipeline handle cleanup of test resources after validation?
- What happens when the second apply detects unexpected drift due to Azure-side changes?
