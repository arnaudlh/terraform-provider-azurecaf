# Dependency Management Strategy

## Overview

This project uses a **hybrid dependency management approach** that combines the strengths of GitHub's Dependabot with custom workflow automation to ensure both efficiency and reliability.

## Strategy

### ðŸ¤– Dependabot (Low-Risk Updates)
**Handles**: GitHub Actions and workflow dependencies  
**Schedule**: Tuesdays at 10:00 AM UTC  
**Rationale**: GitHub Actions updates are typically low-risk and benefit from Dependabot's native integration

### ðŸ”¬ Custom Workflow (High-Risk Updates)  
**Handles**: Go modules and application dependencies  
**Schedule**: Mondays at 9:00 AM UTC  
**Rationale**: Go dependency changes require comprehensive testing before integration

## Why This Approach?

### For a Terraform Provider Project:
1. **Risk Management**: Go dependency changes can break provider functionality
2. **Testing Requirements**: Need extensive testing before dependency updates
3. **Compliance**: Critical infrastructure code requires careful validation
4. **Separation of Concerns**: Different update strategies for different risk levels

## Implementation Details

### Dependabot Configuration (`.github/dependabot.yml`)
```yaml
# Handles GitHub Actions only
- package-ecosystem: "github-actions"
  schedule:
    day: "tuesday"  # Avoid conflict with Go workflow
    time: "10:00"
  # Enhanced grouping and review settings
```

### Custom Go Workflow (`.github/workflows/dependencies.yml`)
```yaml
# Comprehensive Go dependency management
- Pre-PR testing validation
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Critical update detection
- Detailed reporting and artifacts
```

## Workflow Separation

| Aspect | GitHub Actions (Dependabot) | Go Modules (Custom) |
|--------|------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Risk Level** | Low | High |
| **Testing** | Basic CI | Comprehensive |
| **Schedule** | Tuesday 10:00 | Monday 09:00 |
| **Automation** | Full | Conditional |
| **Review** | Standard | Enhanced |

## Benefits

### âœ… Comprehensive Coverage
- **No Gaps**: Both code and CI dependencies managed
- **No Overlap**: Clear separation by ecosystem type
- **Optimal Strategy**: Right tool for each type of dependency

### âœ… Risk-Appropriate Handling
- **Low-Risk Fast**: GitHub Actions updated quickly via Dependabot
- **High-Risk Careful**: Go modules tested thoroughly before PR creation
- **Security First**: Enhanced vulnerability scanning for Go dependencies

### âœ… Developer Experience
- **Clear Separation**: Developers know which system handles what
- **Better Testing**: Fewer broken PRs from dependency updates
- **Detailed Reports**: Rich information for decision-making

## Usage

### Manual Trigger Options

#### Dependabot
```bash
# Trigger via GitHub UI
# Settings â†’ Security â†’ Dependabot â†’ Check for updates
```

#### Custom Go Workflow
```bash
# Via GitHub Actions UI with options:
# - Update type: patch/minor/major
# - Create PR: true/false
```

### Monitoring

#### Check Dependabot Status
- Navigate to **Insights â†’ Dependency graph â†’ Dependabot**
- View scheduled runs and created PRs

#### Check Go Workflow Status  
- Navigate to **Actions â†’ Go Dependency Management**
- View detailed reports and artifacts

## Configuration

### Enable/Disable Components

#### Disable Dependabot (if needed)
```yaml
# In .github/dependabot.yml
# Comment out or remove the github-actions section
```

#### Disable Custom Workflow (if needed)
```yaml
# In .github/workflows/dependencies.yml
# Set schedule to empty or disable workflow
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Conflicting PRs
- **Cause**: Both systems trying to update same dependency type
- **Solution**: Verify separation is maintained (Actions vs Go)

#### Missing Updates
- **GitHub Actions**: Check Dependabot configuration and permissions
- **Go Modules**: Check workflow logs and Go proxy availability

#### Test Failures
- **Custom Workflow**: Reviews logs in workflow run artifacts
- **Resolution**: Manual intervention may be required for complex updates

### Best Practices

1. **Review Major Updates**: Always manually review major version changes
2. **Monitor Security**: Pay attention to security-related updates
3. **Test Locally**: Use `go get -u` locally to test updates first
4. **Coordinate Timing**: Stagger dependency updates to avoid conflicts

## Migration Notes

### From Dependabot-Only
- Go modules moved to custom workflow for better testing
- GitHub Actions remain with Dependabot for efficiency
- Enhanced security scanning added

### From Custom-Only  
- GitHub Actions moved to Dependabot for reduced maintenance
- Go modules remain custom for comprehensive testing
- Better separation of concerns

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
- [ ] Integration with GitHub Security advisories
- [ ] Automated rollback on test failures
- [ ] Enhanced reporting and metrics
- [ ] Integration with semantic versioning

### Monitoring Metrics
- Update frequency and success rates
- Time to merge dependency PRs
- Security vulnerability detection rates
- Test failure rates from dependency changes
